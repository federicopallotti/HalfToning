# HalfToning 
Assignment for the course of Computational Fabrication @USI, held by Professor Piotr Dydik and TA Luca Surace.
We were provided with basic code to process an input image and output the result, and the Thresholding method only.
I implemented the Dithering Method using both 3x3 and 4x4 windows, the Error Diffusion method, the Tone-Dependent weights error diffusion method, and the Error diffusion method using Hilbert Curve and some noised version of these methods.
